# Connect4
This was a personal project where I used OOP to create Connect 4. I also used File I/O and a HashMap to keep track of user's wins.
- Language Used: Java
- Main Concepts Covered: OOP (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism), File I/O, Hash Map, Methods and Arrays

Here is how the game will first look. If the user picks to play the game, the names of the users will be asked
and then the gameboard will appear.
