# Connect4
This is a personal project where I use object-oriented programming in Java to create Connect 4. I also keep track of the wins of each user.

The below steps can be followed to run the program
1. Click the green "Code" button
2. Go to the Codespaces tab and click the "Create codespace on main" button
3. Open the terminal in Codespaces
4. Make the script executable by typing "chmod +x run.sh" in the terminal
5. Run the script by typing "./run.sh" in the terminal
